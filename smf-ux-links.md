# Notes on "The Design of Everyday Things"

- Don’t ignore how people are accustomed to doing an operation in favor of a novel approach. At least explain the mapping from old to new.
- Provide visible indicators of an action: flashing hold button on telephone.
- Mapping multiple actions to a single button with different arbitrary inputs is dangerous.
- Make most important and most used actions bigger and more in your face than auxiliary actions.
- If a system is confusing, people tend to just memorize one sequence of most frequently used actions and not stray beyond that.
- Visibility indicates the mapping of intention to available actions.
- Both a lack of visibility and excessive visibility are problems.
- Important concepts: visibility, appropriate clues, feedback of ones actions.
- Affordance: fundamental properties that determine how an object might be used. A chair is used to sit. Knobs should require no explanation.
- Psychology of causality: events occurring closely action an action are perceived to be related to that action.
- False causality should be avoided: having an unrelated action occur after user command, or having no action to occur after user command.
- Affordances, constraints and mappings. Scissors: the holes are affordances, the size of - the holes constraints. The mapping is flexible in that you can put any fingers into holes. The parts of the machine are visible and continually reactive.
- Bad example: a digital watch with four buttons. No indication of how to set time, a totally arbitrary set of actions and not continuous or internal state readily visible.
- Fundamental principles for good design: provide a good conceptual model, and make things visible.
- A good conceptual model allows us to predict the effect of our actions. It doesn’t necessarily tell us about the internal machinery, but it provides a good and logical mapping of inputs to outputs.
- Bad design: a freezer with two compartments and two cold dials in each compartment. User forms a mental model where each dial is independent. This is not actually the case, they are interlinked and so causes confusion.
- The system image is the part of the system visible to the user. If it is incomplete or inconsistent with the buried internal, then user will be confused.
